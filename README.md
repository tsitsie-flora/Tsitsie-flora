## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Security Engineer by day, outside of work hours I try to do other things, like exploring my creativity. I have been working in Information Security for 4+ years now, and I enjoy it a lot. However, it comes with its ups and downs just like everything else in life.

My current focus is Application/Product Security. On a day to day basis I carry out threat modelling and security assessments, and I collaborate with developers on integrating security into their product features. 

**@tsitsiflora** is also my account, that I lost access to (very funny for a security engineerðŸ˜…). If you want to see stuff that I worked on during my years in university and early career years, you can check that out

*Prompts from Github because why not:*

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on application and/or product security
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the art of threat modelling in real corporate organizations
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on how to effectively shift security left in organizations
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about what I do outside of work
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: munikwatsitsi@gmail.com
- âš¡ Fun fact: I still eat a lot of ice-cream, but also get headaches from coffee withdrawal
